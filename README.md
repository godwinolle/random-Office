# The Office

As a fan of the Office and first time learner of 
Python, I created this project to allow me to 
learn how to work with APIs and making requests 
in Python.

## The Office API

```py
    BASE_URL = "https://officeapi.dev/api"
```

#### Get all characters
```http
    GET /characters/
```

#### Get random episode

```http
    GET /episode/random
```
